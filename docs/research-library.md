# Research library authoring

The private-LAN Research page reads Markdown beneath the configured research directory. A paper can embed a video stored beneath that same directory with a single block line:

```markdown
![Video: Authorization Domains briefing](authorization-domains-briefing.mp4)
```

Paths are relative to the paper. Nested assets work too:

```markdown
![Video: Threat-model walkthrough](media/threat-model.webm)
```

Supported formats are MP4, WebM, and Ogg video (`.ogv`). The viewer renders native playback controls plus an explicit **Full screen** action. Video files remain on the private dash: absolute URLs, parent traversal, hidden paths, unsupported extensions, and symlinks are not embedded or served.

Video production and any paid generation remain separate from the viewer. Place only approved output beside the paper; never place credentials or source material containing secrets in the research publication directory.
